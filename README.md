# vegasReactApp

## App specific instructions

One thing to be mindful of is cors, if there are issues, make sure the site is being accessed through "http://localhost:3000/" not "127.0.0.1:3000" OR alter the cors code in the server OR utilize a chrome cors-modifying extension.

To operate, open a cli in vegasReactApp/simple-server, type npm install to install node packages, enter "node server" to start the server.

Open a cli in vegasReactApp/vegas, type npm install to install node packages, enter "npm start" to boot react app.

### General thoughts

Areas to improve: drawing "hotel" handle from the parameters. Better styling (should've used reactStrap).
